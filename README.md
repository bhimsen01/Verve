# Verve

**Verve** is a web platform designed for college institutions to centralize events, workshops, and student engagement, all in one place.

Unlike traditional event platforms, Verve removes unnecessary friction: **students don’t need to register** to participate. They simply visit the website, explore events, and join in.
